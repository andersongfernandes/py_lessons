Title: "Python Practice Repository - Bro Code's Free Full Course"

Description:
In this repository, I'm sharing my journey of practicing Python using the fantastic "Python Full Course for free" by the Bro Code YouTube channel. You can watch the course <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKHEtdqhLK8">here</a>.

My primary goal is to improve my Python skills, and this repository will contain code and projects I create as I follow along with the course. All credit for the content and lessons goes to Bro Code, and you can find their channel here.
